# Squid ðŸ¦‘
> Like the number of squid species and their **agility**, Squid adapts to all systems to analyze in **real time** the **messages** & **hashtags**.

## Goals
- Trend detection
- Ranking of recent hashtags
- Detection of propaganda content (*soon*)

Squid **is not** a search engine as such.
